# Stock Market Anomaly Detection

This repository contains an implementation of anomaly detection techniques applied to stock market data. The project aims to identify unusual patterns and outliers in stock prices, providing valuable insights for traders and investors.

## Problem Statement
In the stock market, anomalies can signify critical events, such as sudden price drops or spikes, which may indicate underlying issues or opportunities. Detecting these anomalies can help traders make informed decisions, reduce risks, and optimize investment strategies. This project addresses the challenge of identifying these anomalies in stock market data using machine learning and statistical methods.

## Key Features
- **Data Collection**: Gathering stock market data from various sources, including APIs and CSV files.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Anomaly Detection Models**: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies, including:
  - Statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, IQR)
  - Machine learning models (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM)
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of stock price movements, highlighting detected anomalies.
- **Reporting**: Generation of reports summarizing detected anomalies and their potential implications.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas for data manipulation
  - NumPy for numerical calculations
  - Scikit-learn for machine learning
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- **Data Sources**: Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or other stock market APIs
